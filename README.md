This repository contains a versatile calculator program developed in C that offers functionalities for basic arithmetic, complex number calculations, and base-N operations.

## Features

- **Basic Functions**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of real numbers.
- **Complex Calculations**: Conduct operations on complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Base-N Calculation**: Convert numbers between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal representations, and perform binary arithmetic operations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (GCC recommended)

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
